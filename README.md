### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ekaterina. I study on 
### Junior Frontend developer.

- In the begining of my studing in 2022 in September I learn html and css on freeCodeCump.com, and I used sumulators on HTML-academy and some apps on my cell phone to study basic theory.  

- In December I attended studing Stage#0 in (Rolling Scopes School)[rs.school] . I learned how to work with git and github services. And learned the basics of Markdown when I wrote this introduction. Also I repeat basics of Html and css while studing at RSSchool.
